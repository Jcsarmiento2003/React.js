        <Card.Text>
        This is where I started my education. It’s located on a pretty small town in Catanduanes but man I love my elementary days there.  Kinder to grade 4 is the only school level that I accomplish there I would say it’s a fun little journey but I cherish it all because of the people that I’ve met there. In fact, whenever I go there for vacation the classmates that I had in elementary still recognizes me, this place is remarkable for me.

        <Card.Text>
          I’m only at grade 5 where my parents decided to transfer me on this school and this is where I graduated. The experience is alright, I’ve met a couple of friends fewer than when I’m in Catanduanes maybe because of quite a little of time. The adjustment that I need to do is ridiculous I remember when my mom had to pull me to go to this school, because I didn’t know a single person in this school and the adjustment is too much for me.</Card.Text>

        <Card.Text>
        Now this is the time that I also won’t forget this school is one of a kind a bunch of things happens writing this won’t describe even the quarter of the experience I had. The friends, silly jokes, long hours of random conversation and a lot more, this school also where I met my gf, actually we're classmates on elementary but I can’t remember any interaction with her. It is a bit rough because of the bullying frankly I would prefer other school if not because of her.

        Amidst of covid senior high school starts and I couldn’t express myself of how boring the days went it would’ve gone better if only covid is not following are asses. The place is great I mean the school is literally located on a mall 4th floor of the building, tons of amidites as well, food court, grocery store and a bunch of random stores. Did I learn anything? I guess we’ll never know, modular and online is the new way of learning and it sucks.

        Naga College Foundation a school that gave me the importance of education, man things are rough here who would’ve guessed I will finallty focus on academics I guess its the effect of being an adult. It’s a nice school offering a lot of courses and a lot of opportunities, amazing people and a lot of fun to be with. I’m looking forward on the upcoming years and to graduate on this school and make my dreams come true.
